# Scalar-multiplications

This repository contains implementations of three algorithms of additions (and multiplications by a scalar) on elliptic curves.

Algorithms proposed here are GLV, its SPA secure version SAC_GLV and another that uses euclidean addition chains.

Each subdirectory contains implementations of the three algorithms for the corresponding language or platform.
